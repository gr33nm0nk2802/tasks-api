# Tasks API

## Description

A simple RESTful API demo created using Nodejs, express to demonstrate CRUD operations. It also utilizes certain advanced tools like Joi for input validation.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/gr33nm0nk2802/tasks-api.git
```

2. Install dependencies

4. Use Postman or other tools to make CRUD requests to the endpoint  `/api/tasks`
